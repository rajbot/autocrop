This package contains a tool for automatically cropping and deskewing
images of book pages captured by an Internet Archive Scribe bookscanner.

This software was written over the course of a couple months in 2008
and has not been optimized. In its current state, it can process a 
single page image in about 2 seconds on a Scribe bookscanner. Since it
is too slow to run in realtime during the scanning process, it was never 
deployed.

Example output of the autocrop algorithm is available here:

autoCropScibe.c contains the autocrop code for the Scribe bookscanner.

processScribe.py is a wrapper that will process images after the image
capture phase is complete and will write crop and skew information into
scandata.xml (which is created by Scribe).

autoCropScribe depends on the Leptonica image processing library. This
tool has been compiled against Leptonica 1.56 and has not been tested
with more modern versions of Leptionica.

To compile autocrop scribe simply run:

$ make
